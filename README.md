## What it does
Opens the webcam and detects body landmarks like shoulders, elbows, hips and knees in real time. Draws a skeleton structure on the body and shows Pose Detected or No Pose Detected status on screen.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.11
- MediaPipe 0.10.14
- OpenCV 4.8.0.76
- protobuf 4.25.3
- numpy 1.24.3

## What I Learned
Pose detection is a computer vision technique that uses AI to detect and track key points on the human body in real time. This is the core technology used in virtual try-on apps, fitness tracking and gesture recognition.

## How to Run
```
pip install opencv-contrib-python==4.8.0.76 mediapipe==0.10.14 protobuf==4.25.3 numpy==1.24.3
python pose.py
```
